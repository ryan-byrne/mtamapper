        There are two connection modes:
        * In long connection mode, we try to maintain a single long-lived
          connection to the server.  If that connection is lost we will try to
          create a new one whenever put_pixels is called.  This mode is best
          when there's high latency or very high framerates.
        * In short connection mode, we open a connection when it's needed and
          close it immediately after.  This means creating a connection for each
          call to put_pixels. Keeping the connection usually closed makes it
          possible for others to also connect to the server.

        A connection is not established during __init__.  To check if a
        connection will succeed, use can_connect().
